# Template for self correction tasks --> parse the prompt
spot_object_template = """# Your Role: Excellent Parser

## Objective: Analyze scene descriptions to identify objects and their attributes.

## Process Steps
1. Read the user prompt (scene description).
2. Identify all objects mentioned with quantities.
3. Extract attributes of each object (color, size, material, etc.).
4. If the description mentions objects that shouldn't be in the image, take note at the negation part.
5. Explain your understanding (reasoning) and then format your result (answer / negation) as shown in the examples.
6. Importance of Extracting Attributes: Attributes provide specific details about the objects. This helps differentiate between similar objects and gives a clearer understanding of the scene.

## Examples

- Example 1
    User prompt: A brown horse is beneath a black dog. Another orange cat is beneath a brown horse.
    Reasoning: The description talks about three objects: a brown horse, a black dog, and an orange cat. We report the color attribute thoroughly. No specified negation terms. No background is mentioned and thus fill in the default one.
    Objects: [('horse', ['brown']), ('dog', ['black']), ('cat', ['orange'])]
    Background: A realistic image
    Negation: 

- Example 2
    User prompt: There's a white car and a yellow airplane in a garage. They're in front of two dogs and behind a cat. The car is small. Another yellow car is outside the garage.
    Reasoning: The scene has two cars, one airplane, two dogs, and a cat. The car and airplane have colors. The first car also has a size. No specified negation terms. The background is a garage.
    Objects: [('car', ['white and small', 'yellow']), ('airplane', ['yellow']), ('dog', [None, None]), ('cat', [None])]
    Background: A realistic image in a garage
    Negation: 

- Example 3
    User prompt: A car and a dog are on top of an airplane and below a red chair. There's another dog sitting on the mentioned chair.
    Reasoning: Four objects are described: one car, airplane, two dog, and a chair. The chair is red color. No specified negation terms. No background is mentioned and thus fill in the default one.
    Objects: [('car', [None]), ('airplane', [None]), ('dog', [None, None]), ('chair', ['red'])]
    Background: A realistic image
    Negation: 

- Example 4
    User prompt: An oil painting at the beach of a blue bicycle to the left of a bench and to the right of a palm tree with five seagulls in the sky.
    Reasoning: Here, there are five seagulls, one blue bicycle, one palm tree, and one bench. No specified negation terms. The background is an oil painting at the beach.
    Objects: [('bicycle', ['blue']), ('palm tree', [None]), ('seagull', [None, None, None, None, None]), ('bench', [None])]
    Background: An oil painting at the beach
    Negation: 

- Example 5
    User prompt: An animated-style image of a scene without backpacks.
    Reasoning: The description clearly states no backpacks, so this must be acknowledged. The user provides the negative prompt of backpacks. The background is an animated-style image.
    Objects: [('backpacks', [None])]
    Background: An animated-style image
    Negation: backpacks

- Example 6
    User Prompt: Make the dog a sleeping dog and remove all shadows in an image of a grassland.
    Reasoning: The user prompt specifies a sleeping dog on the image and a shadow to be removed. The background is a realistic image of a grassland.                                                                                                                              
    Objects: [('dog', ['sleeping']), ['shadow', [None]]]                                                                                                      
    Background: A realistic image of a grassland                                                                                                              
    Negation: shadows

# Template for self correction tasks --> adjust the bounding boxes
spot_difference_template = """# Your Role: Expert Bounding Box Adjuster

## Objective: Manipulate bounding boxes in square images according to the user prompt while maintaining visual accuracy.

## Bounding Box Specifications and Manipulations
1. Image Coordinates: Define square images with top-left at [0, 0] and bottom-right at [1, 1].
2. Box Format: [Top-left x, Top-left y, Width, Height]
3. Operations: Include addition, deletion, repositioning, and attribute modification.

## Key Guidelines
1. Alignment: Follow the user's prompt, keeping the specified object count and attributes. Deem it deeming it incorrect if the described object lacks specified attributes.
2. Boundary Adherence: Keep bounding box coordinates within [0, 1].
3. Minimal Modifications: Change bounding boxes only if they don't match the user's prompt (i.e., don't modify matched objects).
4. Overlap Reduction: Minimize intersections in new boxes and remove the smallest, least overlapping objects.

## Process Steps
1. Interpret prompts: Read and understand the user's prompt.
2. Implement Changes: Review and adjust current bounding boxes to meet user specifications.
3. Explain Adjustments: Justify the reasons behind each alteration and ensure every adjustment abides by the key guidelines.
4. Output the Result: Present the reasoning first, followed by the updated objects section, which should include a list of bounding boxes in Python format.

## Examples

- Example 1
    User prompt: A realistic image of landscape scene depicting a green car parking on the left of a blue truck, with a red air balloon and a bird in the sky
    Current Objects: [('green car #1', [0.027, 0.365, 0.275, 0.207]), ('blue truck #1', [0.350, 0.368, 0.272, 0.208]), ('red air balloon #1', [0.086, 0.010, 0.189, 0.176])]
    Reasoning: To add a bird in the sky as per the prompt, ensuring all coordinates and dimensions remain within [0, 1].
    Updated Objects: [('green car #1', [0.027, 0.365, 0.275, 0.207]), ('blue truck #1', [0.350, 0.369, 0.272, 0.208]), ('red air balloon #1', [0.086, 0.010, 0.189, 0.176]), ('bird #1', [0.385, 0.054, 0.186, 0.130])]

- Example 2
    User prompt: A realistic image of landscape scene depicting a green car parking on the right of a blue truck, with a red air balloon and a bird in the sky
    Current Output Objects: [('green car #1', [0.027, 0.365, 0.275, 0.207]), ('blue truck #1', [0.350, 0.369, 0.272, 0.208]), ('red air balloon #1', [0.086, 0.010, 0.189, 0.176])]
    Reasoning: The relative positions of the green car and blue truck do not match the prompt. Swap positions of the green car and blue truck to match the prompt, while keeping all coordinates and dimensions within [0, 1].
    Updated Objects:  [('green car #1', [0.350, 0.369, 0.275, 0.207]), ('blue truck #1', [0.027, 0.365, 0.272, 0.208]), ('red air balloon #1', [0.086, 0.010, 0.189, 0.176]), ('bird #1', [0.485, 0.054, 0.186, 0.130])]

- Example 3
    User prompt: An oil painting of a pink dolphin jumping on the left of a steam boat on the sea
    Current Objects: [('steam boat #1', [0.302, 0.293, 0.335, 0.194]), ('pink dolphin #1', [0.027, 0.324, 0.246, 0.160]), ('blue dolphin #1', [0.158, 0.454, 0.376, 0.290])]
    Reasoning: The prompt mentions only one dolphin, but two are present. Thus, remove one dolphin to match the prompt, ensuring all coordinates and dimensions stay within [0, 1].
    Updated Objects: [('steam boat #1', [0.302, 0.293, 0.335, 0.194]), ('pink dolphin #1', [0.027, 0.324, 0.246, 0.160])]

- Example 4

    Current Objects: [('steam boat #1', [0.302, 0.293, 0.335, 0.194]), ('dolphin #1', [0.027, 0.324, 0.246, 0.160])]
    Reasoning: The prompt specifies a pink dolphin, but there's only a generic one. The attribute needs to be changed.
    Updated Objects: [('steam boat #1', [0.302, 0.293, 0.335, 0.194]), ('pink dolphin #1', [0.027, 0.324, 0.246, 0.160])]

- Example 5
    User prompt: A realistic photo of a scene with a brown bowl on the right and a gray dog on the left
    Current Objects: [('gray dog #1', [0.186, 0.592, 0.449, 0.408]), ('brown bowl #1', [0.376, 0.194, 0.624, 0.502])]
    Reasoning: The leftmost coordinate (0.186) of the gray dog's bounding box is positioned to the left of the leftmost coordinate (0.376) of the brown bowl, while the rightmost coordinate (0.186 + 0.449) of the bounding box has not extended beyond the rightmost coordinate of the bowl. Thus, the image aligns with the user's prompt, requiring no further modifications.
    Updated Objects: [('gray dog #1', [0.186, 0.592, 0.449, 0.408]), ('brown bowl #1', [0.376, 0.194, 0.624, 0.502])]

Your Current Task: Carefully follow the provided guidelines and steps to adjust bounding boxes in accordance with the user's prompt. Ensure adherence to the above output format.

    Reasoning: There are two bowls in the image. To add a pink bowl between the two, the x coordinates should be placed between 0.076 and 0.676 and the y coordinates should be between 0.494 and 0.494. When adding the object, be sure to prevent overlapping between existing objects and make sure the [top-left x-coordinate, top-left y-coordinate, top-left x-coordinate+box width, top-left y-coordinate+box height] lie between 0 and 1.
